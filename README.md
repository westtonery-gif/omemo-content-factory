# OMEMO Content Factory

Industrial multi-agent content production system for **OMEMO Health** — a
managed, reproducible, human-in-the-loop pipeline for producing content.

> **Status:** ROADMAP **Stage 2 — domain models & contracts**.
> The domain core is implemented: the **Run** aggregate and its child entities
> **Task, Output, Artifact** and **Human Review** (ADR-0003…0007), with a minimal
> `ContentDirector` and an LLM-backed task executor. Full agents, skills, tools,
> adapters and workflows arrive in later stages.

## Documentation (source of truth)

The architecture is governed by three charters, in strict order of authority:

| Document | Answers |
|----------|---------|
| [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) | **What** we are building and by which principles |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | **How** the system is structured |
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | In **which order** we implement it |
| [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md) | **Why** each architectural decision was made |

Code must never contradict the documentation; on conflict, the documentation
wins (PROJECT.md, section 17).

## Requirements

- Python **3.11+**
- git

## Quickstart

Create a virtual environment and install the project with its dev tooling:

```bash
# bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Configure the environment (optional — sensible defaults are used otherwise):

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # bash
Copy-Item .env.example .env # PowerShell
```

> At Stage 1 variables are read directly from the **process environment**
> (`OMEMO_APP_ENV`, `OMEMO_LOG_LEVEL`). A `.env` auto-loader is intentionally not
> part of Stage 1. Export the variables in your shell, or set them inline.

## Running the checks

The local quality gate mirrors CI exactly:

```bash
ruff format --check .   # formatting
ruff check .            # linting
mypy                    # static typing (strict)
pytest                  # tests
```

Use `ruff format .` to apply formatting, and `pytest --cov` for coverage.

## Using pre-commit

`pre-commit` is the **first level of quality control** (ADR-0002 Revision 1). It
runs the approved checks automatically each time you create a commit, so obvious
problems are caught **before** they enter the repository. It does **not** replace
CI — CI remains the authoritative gate (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

**1. Install the dependencies** (the dev extra includes `pre-commit` and the
tools the hooks use):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**2. Install the git hooks** (one-time, per clone):

```bash
pre-commit install
```

**What happens on commit.** When you run `git commit`, pre-commit runs the three
approved checks on the project:

- **Ruff Format** — applies formatting;
- **Ruff Check** — lints the code;
- **mypy** — static type checking (strict).

If everything passes, the commit is created. If a check fails (or Ruff Format
reformats files), **the commit is aborted**.

**If a check fails:**

1. Read the hook output to see what failed.
2. If **Ruff Format** changed files, or you fix lint/type errors, **re-stage**
   the changed files (`git add ...`) and commit again.
3. Re-run the hooks manually at any time without committing:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

> Bypassing the hooks (`git commit --no-verify`) is discouraged: CI runs the same
> checks and will fail the Pull Request anyway.

## Running the smoke entrypoint

A Stage 1 entrypoint that proves the package installs, imports and reads
configuration (no business logic, no external calls):

```bash
python -m omemo_content_factory
```

It logs the version, the active environment and the log level.

## Running the demo

`demo.py` runs one workflow — Research → Writer → Editor — through the real
`ContentDirector` and the Run/Task/Output/Artifact domain, with each role backed
by a live Anthropic model behind the application's `TaskExecutor` port:

```bash
python demo.py
```

A real model call needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment (optionally
`OMEMO_LLM_MODEL` to choose the model); without a key the demo explains how to
set it and exits cleanly. No QA, Human Review, publication or external
integrations are involved.

**Build → Test → Commit → Review**, and architectural changes require an
