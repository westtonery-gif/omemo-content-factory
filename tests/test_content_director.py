"""Integration tests for the minimal ContentDirector (``application.content_director``).

These verify that the coordinator sequences the existing domain into one whole workflow:
multiple Tasks are opened and executed through the Run root, and the Run is finalised to the
correct terminal state for the outcome. They do **not** re-test the Run/Task state machines or
``execute_task`` itself (covered by the run / task / task-execution test modules).
Deterministic fake executors stand in for real work; no LLM, network or infrastructure.
