"""Run domain model — first working implementation of the aggregate.

This module implements the ``Run`` aggregate exactly as agreed in **ADR-0003 "Run domain
model interface contract"**, the sole source of the technical contract. The public interface
(the ``create`` factory, the read-only properties, ``transition`` and the
``RunStatus`` / ``Actor`` / ``ReworkPolicy`` / event / error types) is unchanged from the
accepted contract — only ``Run`` itself moves from a ``Protocol`` stub to a concrete,
instantiable aggregate, as ADR-0003 §3 requires (construction via ``Run.create()``).

**ADR-0004 "Task aggregate — Run↔Task interface contract"** additively extends Run with
management of its first child entity, ``Task`` (``open_task`` / ``transition_task`` /
read-only ``tasks`` / ``task``). This is an Open/Closed extension (PROJECT.md §4.11): Run's
existing behaviour, signatures and tests are unchanged; only new operations are added. The
``Task`` entity itself lives in ``omemo_content_factory.domain.task``.

It contains no infrastructure, persistence, serialization, async/threading or integrations,
and no child entities beyond ``Task`` (the others — Artifact, Evaluation, Human Review,
Analytics Record — remain out of scope; see the accompanying acceptance docs).

Scenario identifiers in docstrings (e.g. ``HP-01``, ``FL-03``, ``THP-01``) refer to
`RUN_ACCEPTANCE.md` and `TASK_ACCEPTANCE.md`.

Representation note (per ADR-0003 §3): identifiers and references the domain leaves opaque are
represented as plain ``str`` references — the minimal typing needed, with no added semantics.
