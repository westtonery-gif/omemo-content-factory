"""Infrastructure layer — isolation from external providers and the outside world.

This is the outermost layer (ARCHITECTURE.md §9, §15): it depends on the application and domain
layers, never the reverse, and the domain knows nothing of what lives here. The first inhabitant
is the LLM access used to run real models behind the application's ``TaskExecutor`` port (the
provider stays swappable — PROJECT.md §5, §7).
