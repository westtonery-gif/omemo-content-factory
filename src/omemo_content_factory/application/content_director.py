"""Minimal ContentDirector — prove the existing domain runs a whole workflow.

A small, deterministic coordinator that sequences the **already existing** public operations
of the Run aggregate and the ``execute_task`` slice into one end-to-end workflow. It exists to
demonstrate that Run + Task + ``execute_task`` already function as a single system.

It is intentionally **not**: an intelligent agent, a production orchestrator, or the future
Content Director / Workflow Engine of ARCHITECTURE.md §4-5. It adds no new domain concepts,
introduces no infrastructure (no LLM, network, adapters, queues), never bypasses the Run
aggregate root, and changes nothing in Run or Task.

The work itself is delegated to an injected :class:`TaskExecutor` (a deterministic fake in
tests and in the demo). When a Task succeeds with structured output, its ``Output`` is recorded
through the Run and an ``Artifact`` is created from it (provenance ``Task -> Output -> Artifact``).
