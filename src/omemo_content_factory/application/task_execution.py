"""Minimal task-execution slice — prove a Run can execute one Task end to end.

This is the **smallest application-layer component** that drives a single Task through its
lifecycle inside a Run, coordinating everything **through the Run aggregate root** (never
bypassing it) and using an injected, deterministic executor instead of doing real work.

It validates the architecture, not a feature: a Run creates a Task, the Task transitions
through its lifecycle, Run coordinates it, domain events are recorded and the aggregate
invariants hold (including "a Run cannot complete with a non-terminal Task").

A successful execution records the Task's domain ``Output`` **only via the unified validated path**
(3D, evaluation-ownership Variant A): when a ``schema`` is supplied and the result carries
``output`` + ``schema_ref`` + structured ``payload_fields``, the application invokes
``Schema.validate`` (Schema = authority) and the pure sink ``Run.record_output`` persists the
VALID/INVALID verdict. There is no legacy always-VALID path. Still deliberately **out of scope**:
QA / Human Approval; providers; adapters; queues; Skills; Tools; and any infrastructure.
